OpenCV requires windows drivers, and here is the installation process

  1. Navigate to: "C:\Windows\System32" in windows explorer
  
  2. Copy and paste the .dll from the appropriate system architecture file to that directory
  
  3. Test to make sure you did this correctly by opening eclipse, adding the OpenCv.jar in this folder to the buildpath
    
    a. Copy the code from test.java to your project, and if there are no errors, you did it correctly
    
    b. if there are errors, try the other architecture file
